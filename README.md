🛡️ SaferStep – Smart Safety Navigator for Safer Journeys

**SaferStep** is our attempt to make city navigation safer, especially for women, students, and solo travelers. It’s a web and mobile app that helps you plan routes based on real-time crime data, community alerts, and AI-driven safety scores — because feeling safe should be part of every journey.

## 💡 Why We Built This

Ever felt uneasy walking home late at night? We did too. So we thought — what if maps didn’t just show us the fastest route, but the *safest* one?

That’s how **SaferStep** was born at the Intel Enterprise AI Hackathon, where we wanted to combine **AI, maps, and real-world safety data** to create something that genuinely helps people move more confidently through their cities.
